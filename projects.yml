    I was the Deputy Director of Technology at the
    [DNC](http://democrats.org/) from the fall of 2011 to the spring of
    2013, during the 2012 presidential and general election. I oversaw our
    software engineering efforts and worked to help re-elect President Obama and
    put Democrats into office across the country. We collaborated closely with the
    OFA campaign in Chicago, providing technical assistance, institutional
    knowledge, and developing our own suite of software packages. These were
    mainly focussed on volunteer and voter engagement, and get-out-the-vote (GOTV)
    efforts. For example, I led the development of the party’s polling place
    locator (seen at right), which also powered the Obama campaign’s polling place
    lookup tool, and handled millions of requests from voters during the GOTV
    weekend leading up to Election Day 2012. I also created the Digital Slate
    Card, which gave voters a list of the endorsed Democratic candidates that
    would be on the ballot where they were registered to vote.


    I also led efforts to open up more of the source code of the software
    generated by the party. During the height of the campaign, we
    [released an open source online voter registration application][1]

name: EveryBlock

    I co-founded [EveryBlock](http://everyblock.com/)
    with [Adrian
    Holovaty](http://holovaty.com/), [Wilson Miner](http://wilsonminer.com/),
    and [Dan X. O’Neil](http://www.derivativeworks.com/) in
    2007 in Chicago.

    I developed the site along with Adrian, writing Python code for the
    Django-based application, administering the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database,
    writing JavaScript for various front-end elements including our
    OpenLayers-based custom maps. We were early users of Mapnik, which we used to
    create the map tiles. I also developed a custom nginx module to efficiently
    serve the tiles. I wrote [an article about our maps](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps "Take
    Control of Your Maps (A List Part No. 256)").

    I co-founded [Friends of the
    Bloomingdale Trail](http://bloomingdaletrail.org/) in 2003, an all-volunteer non-profit
    organization that advocates for the conversion of an unused elevated
    rail line on the north side of Chicago to a multi-use greenspace and
    park. I designed and developed the FBT site, which is a Django app.

name: Election Day Advent Calendar

    In 2006, my co-conspirator Ben Helphand and I, calling ourselves
    “[Gerrymander](http://gerrymanderpresents.com/)” (slogan: Make Small
    Plans), conceived, designed (with help from Andrew Seay), produced,
    printed, and sold [the Election Day Advent
    Calendar](http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2006/). Like a regular
    Advent calendar counts down the days ‘til Christmas, our political-nerd
    take on it counted down the days leading up to the 2006 midterm election.
    You opened a door each day and it would reveal a quote or fact about our
    democracy. This was an actual 11"×17", full-color, printed, die-cut
    calendar. We sold a fair number, more or less broke even, and declared it
    a success from our modest expectations. With design help from [Melissa
    Dean](http://mdeanstudio.com), we repeated the effort in with [a new
    calendar for the 2008
    election](http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2008/).

    I designed and developed another Django app in 2006, a personal

    As part of my freelance web developer career, I made a number of web apps
    for Crain’s Chicago Business, based around a news cycle and a data set.
    One example was [Mayor Daley’s
    Contributions](http://interactive.chicagobusiness.com/daley/), which let
    you query a database of contributions made to the mayor in the run-up to
    the 2007 municipal elections. The contributions were also mapped. This was
    a Django app.

name: Civic Footprint
img: /images/portfolio/civic-footprint-homepage.png
description: >
    I created a site while at the [Center for Neighborhood
    Technology](http://cnt.org/) in 2005 called the Civic Footprint. This was
    a site where you typed in your address, and it showed you who represented
    you politically, down to the local level (congressman, state senator,
    alderman, etc.), and a map of all your political geographies. This was an
    early Ruby on Rails site, and I hacked in geospatial support to
    ActiveRecord so that I could make queries against the PostGIS database
    containing the political boundaries. The maps were generated by
    [MapServer](http://mapserver.org/).
