<h1>Selected projects &amp; work</h1>

<h2>EveryBlock</h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a>
with <a href="http://holovaty.com/">Adrian
Holovaty</a>, <a href="http://wilsonminer.com/">Wilson Miner</a>,
and <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/">Dan X. O’Neil</a> in
2007 in Chicago.</p>

<p>I developed the site along with Adrian, writing Python code for the
Django-based application, administering the PostgreSQL/PostGIS
database, writing JavaScript for various front-end elements including
our OpenLayers-based custom maps (I
wrote <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps"
title="Take Control of Your Maps (A List Part No. 256)">an article about
our maps</a>), including developing a custom nginx module to
efficiently serve our map tiles.
</p>

<h2>Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail</h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://bloomingdaletrail.org/">Friends of the
Bloomingdale Trail</a> in 2003, an all-volunteer non-profit
organization that advocates for the conversion of an unused elevated
rail line on the north side of Chicago to a multi-use greenspace and
park. I designed and developed the FBT site, which is a Django app.
</p>

<h2>Election Day Advent Calendar</h2>

<p>In 2006, my co-conspirator Ben Helphand and I, calling ourselves
“<a href="http://gerrymanderpresents.com/">Gerrymander</a>” (slogan:
Make Small Plans), conceived, designed (with help from Andrew Seay),
produced, printed, and
sold <a href="http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2006/">the Election
Day Advent Calendar</a>. Like a regular Advent calendar counts down
the days ‘til Christmas, our political-nerd take on it counted down
the days leading up to the 2006 midterm election. You opened a door
each day and it would reveal a quote or fact about our democracy. This
was an actual 11"×17", full-color, printed, die-cut calendar. We sold
a fair number, more or less broke even, and declared it a success from
our modest expectations. With design help from Melissa Dean, we
repeated the effort in
with <a href="http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2008/">a new
calendar for the 2008 election</a>.
</p>

<h2>Chris Hayes</h2>

<p>I designed and developed another Django app in 2006, a personal
site for my friend the
journalist <a href="http://chrishayes.org/">Chris Hayes</a>,
Washington editor of The Nation and an MSNBC contributor.
</p>

<h2>Crain’s sites</h2>

<p>As part of my freelance web developer career, I made a number of web
apps for Crain’s Chicago Business, based around a news cycle and a
data set. One example
was <a href="http://interactive.chicagobusiness.com/daley/">Mayor
Daley’s Contributions</a>, which let you query a database of
contributions made to the mayor in the run-up to the 2007 municipal
elections. The contributions were also mapped. This was a Django app.
</p>

<h2>Civic Footprint</h2>

<p>I created a site while at the <a href="http://cnt.org/">Center for
Neighborhood Technology</a> in 2005 called the Civic Footprint. This
was a site where you typed in your address, and it showed you who
represented you politically, down to the local level (congressman,
state senator, alderman, etc.), and a map of all your political
geographies. This was an early Ruby on Rails site, and I hacked in
geospatial support to ActiveRecord so that I could make queries
against the PostGIS database containing the political boundaries. The
maps were generated by <a href="http://mapserver.org/">MapServer</a>.
