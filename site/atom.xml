    <title>Use Oplop for your web site passwords</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.google.com/?q=gawker+breach&#34;&gt;Gawker breach&lt;/a&gt; showed what we’ve known for a while, that
we don’t use good strong passwords, and we use the same password over
and over again on multiple sites. This is a problem because a breach
at one site potentially means a breach across a number of sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to address this problem is to use a password generator—the
idea is that all you have to remember is a single, good, strong
password, and the password generator will spit out a random string of
characters to be used as a password on a particular site. This
generated password is hard for an attacker to guess, and hard for them
to “crack” with password-attacking software. You’re not supposed to
remember or even care what the actual password is: you just remember
the master password. And if one of the sites you have an account with
is compromised, it may suck for you with respect to your sensitive
information on that site, but because the generated password is unique
to the site, you’re safe from having it used against you on other
sites where you have accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The password generator I use is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://oplop.appspot.com/&#34;&gt;Oplop&lt;/a&gt;. It’s just a web
site, so you visit it in your browser; there’s nothing to
install. There are two fields to enter—a nickname, and the master
password. The nickname is any name you want to identify the site or
service for which you need a password. After you enter a nickname and
your master password, you click the “Create” button, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/oplop/wiki/HowItWorks&#34;&gt;an
unguessable password is generated&lt;/a&gt; for you in the field below the
button. Enter that password into the site that’s asking you for a
password, and you’re all done. The next time you visit the site and
need to enter your password, you repeat the process exactly to get the
same unique password that’s just for that site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few tips and tricks to using Oplop successfully. The
nickname is just a label that you remember to refer to the site you
need a password for, but if it is different by even one character, an
entirely different password will be generated. So it’s important to be
consistent, and ideally use a simple convention so that you enter the
label the same way every time. I’ve chosen a convention of using
all-lowercase and no non-alphanumeric characters, and the domain name
of the site, minus the top-level domain (the .com or .org, etc.). For
example, if I’m visiting amazon.com, I’ll use “amazon” (without the
quotes) for the nickname. If I was visiting a site with the domain
name “Cat-Pics-123.net”, I’d use “catpics123” for the
nickname. Whatever your convention for nicknames, it should be simple
and you should use it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your master password should be a good one—fairly long and hard to
guess—since it is the key to the kingdom. Security researchers often
praise the idea of “passphrase,” a sentence instead of a single
word. These can often be easier to remember and are just as strong if
not stronger than shorter, gobbledygook passwords, even if the
passphrase is composed of simple words. A four or five word sentence,
separated with spaces, should suffice, although longer passphrases are
even better. In any case, use care when entering your master password
into Oplop. By default, it doesn’t do any checking, so, like in the
case of the nickname, a single character’s difference means a whole
different generated password. You can optionally click on the checkbox
“Validate master password?”, which adds an additional password field
for you to re-enter your master password, providing a simple check
that might catch a typo in the first field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final tip is to cut-and-paste the generated password out of its
field instead of copy-and-paste. It’s not so much a tip per se because
Oplop recommends that you do this right on the page, but it’s
important enough to reiterate. Doing it this way prevents someone from
snooping over your shoulder, or if you are careless and leave the
Oplop page open untentionally on a shared computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have stopped short at the notion of a web-based password
generator. Isn’t it insecure to trust a web site to generate a
password for you? The answer is, you are only actually interacting
with your browser—there is no network activity taking place when you
generate a password with Oplop. That is because the entire Oplop
program is just HTML and JavaScript loaded in your browser, and it is
your browser on your local computer that takes the nickname and master
password, performs the cryptographic magic on them, and outputs the
generated password. In fact, Oplop works offline just as well. You can
test it by visiting the site and bookmarking it on your iPhone or
Android, deleting the browser window, putting the phone in airplane
mode, then loading Oplop from the bookmark. It works just the same as
if you were connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The browser-centric nature of Oplop gets to another key concept about
it—there’s nothing to install. In fact, it is essentially already
installed on any internet-enabled device with a JavaScript-enabled
browser. There’s no central database of account names and generated
passwords, like you might expect, and which password generators like
1Password and Password Gorilla are built around. These programs work
similarly to Oplop in the end result, but their central database
presents a user experience problem—it needs to be shared among the
computers you want to use the program on. This can make it difficult
to retrieve a password if you are on your friend’s laptop or a PC at
an internet café. Not only do you have to install the password
generator software itself, if you are allowed to by policy of the
computer’s owner or manager, you have to synchronize the central
database with the computer. By simply eschewing the notion of storing
account names and passwords, Oplop provides a universally-accessible
password management tool. Those unique generated passwords are just
ephemera, the results of combining the secret you keep in your head
(your master password), the site nicknames, and a cryptographic
function in your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other approaches to securing your passwords and the web
accounts you access, including [writing them down]. In fact, if you
have trouble remembering strong passwords or passphrases of sufficient
length, you might consider writing down your Oplop master password on
a slip of paper you keep in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>del.icio.us is dead, long live del.icio.us</title>
    <link href="/blog/2010/12/delicious.html" />

    <updated>2010-12-17T05:55:03Z</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/delicious-logo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Delicious logo&#34;
style=&#34;float: right; margin-left: 1em; padding: 5px&#34;&gt; It slipped today
that Yahoo! will soon to shut down &lt;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/&#34;&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt;, née
del.icio.us, the social bookmarking site. When it became obvious a few
years ago care and feeding of the site had more or less stopped, I
fled the service, like many other users, for the clones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delicious was important for two reasons. It was all about
discovery—what your friends and the other interesting people you were
following were reading. Predating Digg and reddit, it was the first
service to do what Twitter and Facebook now do so well—point you at a
URL you will probably be interested in, by virtue of having been
vetted by your social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also important because it popularized &#34;folksonomies,&#34; the
now-ubiqitous act of tagging items as a lightweight, and therefore
actually used and useful, alternative to categorization. You can thank
del.icio.us for tag clouds and high-quality Flickr searches, for
example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delicious was internet plumbing, but it never became essential
internet plumbing. You could automatically update your blog from it
with what you were reading (and so many people did that they stopped
writing in long-form and just published from their Delicious accounts
a link and some commentary, it resembled an early Twitter-esque
microblog in that way). Lots of people offloaded their brains to it
(especially reference material and how-to guides and programming tips,
learning stuff they intended to come back to later). But unlike its
big Yahoo! sister Flickr, which has become an essential pipeline for
web images, Delicious never grew much beyond what it was in the early
days, never caught fire as a social network in its own right despite
millions of users. Whether this was due to neglect or mismanagement or
cluelessness, in any case, it was a missed opportunity, to become
essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/simonw/status/15519434139508736&#34;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nielsen/status/15511360536313857&#34;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nielsen/status/15515090346315776&#34;&gt;wondering&lt;/a&gt; if Yahoo!
understands what the shutdown means for their reputation, when it
comes to safeguarding user data or being reliably available. It&#39;s a
classic &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dataliberation.org/&#34;&gt;data liberation&lt;/a&gt; problem, and if Yahoo! doesn&#39;t make
it easy for users to take their bookmarks out of Delicious (or their
photos out of Flickr for that matter), folks might not trust a future
Yahoo! product with their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmarking lives on despite the fact that you can pretty much Google
anything, replacing the offboard-brain reference index, and that
social network-based discovery is now dominated by Twitter and
Facebook—people still like being able to curate their own little
slice of the web. &lt;a href=&#34;http://pinboard.in/&#34;&gt;pinboard.in&lt;/a&gt; is one post-Delicious site
that looks particularly promising and vital; tellingly, it refers to
itself as anti-social bookmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewall, Delicious—for a few years at least, you were essential to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://delicious.com/thaislump&#34;&gt;me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I know about old things</title>
    <link href="/blog/2010/10/old_things.html" />
    <id>http://pauladamsmith.com/blog/2010/10/old_things.html</id>
    <updated>2010-10-31T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/23/farewellToThePhone.html&#34;&gt;This post by Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; is an example of an observation I’ve seen
made recently, which roughly goes, kids today, they didn’t grow up
with ringing-bell, handset-style telephones, or floppy disks, to name
two obsolete technologies, and so our icons for “call” and “save” in
our software don’t mean anything to them, because they don’t know what
those icons stand for (and by extension, what action is expected to
happen when you click on them). I think this overstates things. We
should always strive for better, more universally-understood metaphors
in our graphical interfaces, to make software easier to use and more
accessible. The idea that future kids won’t know about technologies
that had their heyday prior to their consciousness is belied by the
fact that I know about things before 1977, stuff like kerosene lamps,
telegraphs, and muskets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s set aside the fact that abstract graphical representations of
physical things, icons, tend to take on lives of their own, semantic
meanings that diverge from their real-world analogues (think folders,
files, and the desktop), so we don’t need to fully understand or even
be aware of the physical object to successfully use the virtual
one. (It’s not as if we had in-born knowledge of telephones and floppy
disks, and similarly we have to learn about software and its metaphors
in their own context.) In part because there is uneven deployment and
obsolescence of technology, in part because of cultural memory like
movies, and in part because of software and the Internet, we will
remember, and especially we will remember technologies that overlap,
in function or metaphor, and which are relevant to our contemporary
technology stories.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>I wrote an article about Redis</title>
    <link href="/blog/2010/10/redis.html" />

    <updated>2010-10-18T16:00:00Z</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Redis more and more lately, and I started poking
around in the source code trying to understand it better. I wrote &lt;a
href=&#34;/articles/redis-under-the-hood.html&#34;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; about how
Redis starts up and processes the request/response cycle. I think this
is just the beginning of my Redis explorations—we’re already using it
quite a bit at work, and I have an idea for a new data type that could
be really useful. I plan to write at least one more longish article
like this about it, on following in close detail how a SET and a GET
command make their way through the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redis is an extremely cool project. The main contributors are focused
on making it fast, bug-free, and keeping it small (in the sense of
features, code base, complexity). They&#39;re also working on a
distributed version that could be very promising, taking it beyond
what is already IMO a very successful single process model.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
