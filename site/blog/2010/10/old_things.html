  <p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/23/farewellToThePhone.html">This post by Dave Winer</a> is an example of an observation I’ve seen
made recently, which roughly goes, kids today, they didn’t grow up
with ringing-bell, handset-style telephones, or floppy disks, to name
two obsolete technologies, and so our icons for “call” and “save” in
our software don’t mean anything to them, because they don’t know what
those icons stand for (and by extension, what action is expected to
happen when you click on them). I think this overstates things. We
should always strive for better, more universally-understood metaphors
in our graphical interfaces, to make software easier to use and more
accessible. The idea that future kids won’t know about technologies
that had their heyday prior to their consciousness is belied by the
fact that I know about things before 1977, stuff like kerosene lamps,
telegraphs, and muskets.</p>
<p>Let’s set aside the fact that abstract graphical representations of
physical things, icons, tend to take on lives of their own, semantic
meanings that diverge from their real-world analogues (think folders,
files, and the desktop), so we don’t need to fully understand or even
be aware of the physical object to successfully use the virtual
one. (It’s not as if we had in-born knowledge of telephones and floppy
disks, and similarly we have to learn about software and its metaphors
in their own context.) In part because there is uneven deployment and
obsolescence of technology, in part because of cultural memory like
movies, and in part because of software and the Internet, we will
remember, and especially we will remember technologies that overlap,
in function or metaphor, and which are relevant to our contemporary
technology stories.</p>
