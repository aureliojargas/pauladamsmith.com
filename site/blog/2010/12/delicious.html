  <p><img src="/images/delicious-logo.png" alt="Delicious logo"
style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; padding: 5px"> It slipped today
that Yahoo! will soon to shut down <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a>, née
del.icio.us, the social bookmarking site. When it became obvious a few
years ago care and feeding of the site had more or less stopped, I
fled the service, like many other users, for the clones.</p>
<p>Delicious was important for two reasons. It was all about
discovery—what your friends and the other interesting people you were
following were reading. Predating Digg and reddit, it was the first
service to do what Twitter and Facebook now do so well—point you at a
URL you will probably be interested in, by virtue of having been
vetted by your social network.</p>
<p>It was also important because it popularized "folksonomies," the
now-ubiqitous act of tagging items as a lightweight, and therefore
actually used and useful, alternative to categorization. You can thank
del.icio.us for tag clouds and high-quality Flickr searches, for
example.</p>
<p>Delicious was internet plumbing, but it never became essential
internet plumbing. You could automatically update your blog from it
with what you were reading (and so many people did that they stopped
writing in long-form and just published from their Delicious accounts
a link and some commentary, it resembled an early Twitter-esque
microblog in that way). Lots of people offloaded their brains to it
(especially reference material and how-to guides and programming tips,
learning stuff they intended to come back to later). But unlike its
big Yahoo! sister Flickr, which has become an essential pipeline for
web images, Delicious never grew much beyond what it was in the early
days, never caught fire as a social network in its own right despite
millions of users. Whether this was due to neglect or mismanagement or
cluelessness, in any case, it was a missed opportunity, to become
essential.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/simonw/status/15519434139508736">People</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nielsen/status/15511360536313857">are</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michael_nielsen/status/15515090346315776">wondering</a> if Yahoo!
understands what the shutdown means for their reputation, when it
comes to safeguarding user data or being reliably available. It's a
classic <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">data liberation</a> problem, and if Yahoo! doesn't make
it easy for users to take their bookmarks out of Delicious (or their
photos out of Flickr for that matter), folks might not trust a future
Yahoo! product with their data.</p>
<p>Bookmarking lives on despite the fact that you can pretty much Google
anything, replacing the offboard-brain reference index, and that
social network-based discovery is now dominated by Twitter and
Facebook—people still like being able to curate their own little
slice of the web. <a href="http://pinboard.in/">pinboard.in</a> is one post-Delicious site
that looks particularly promising and vital; tellingly, it refers to
itself as anti-social bookmarking.</p>
<p>Farewall, Delicious—for a few years at least, you were essential to
<a href="http://delicious.com/thaislump">me</a>.</p>
