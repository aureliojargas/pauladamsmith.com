  <p>For the past <em>n</em> years, I’ve built and hosted a web app that lets my film
buff friends and me compete by guessing who will win the Academy Awards by
voting for nominees in each category. I do a new one from scratch each time.
It’s a fun diversion, but it’s also a playground for me to try out new
skills picked up in the past year or new tools or techniques I’ve been wanting
to fool around with.</p>

<p>The first thing I need to do each time is get a list of that year’s nominees
in some machine-readable format. Being a lazy programmer, I’m not going to
type in the 100+ nominees into a spreadsheet or text file, so I wind up
writing a short throwaway script to coax some list I’ve found online into the
form I need for importing. This sort of script is the meat-and-potatoes of the
workaday programmer, the ones you whip up in a few minutes as an intermediate
step in a larger task. Ordinarily, they’re hardly worth commenting on. They
have a vanishingly short half-life, since there is rarely any generality to be
derived from them: they only work on the exact input given.</p>

<p>This year, I wanted to try out a new way of getting the nominee list together.
Sure, for a small task like this, there’s no compelling reason not to go with
the same kind of quick throwaway script as before. But again, the point of the
Oscars app is to exercise new or different muscles.</p>

<p>My goal was to generate a representation of the list of nominees in a format
such as CSV suitable for importing into a database. I found a source list of
nominees, formatted as follows: the name of the category is on the first line,
then a list of nominees comes next, each requiring two lines, one being the
name of the film and the other a name or list of names associated with the
nomination, all followed by a blank line, then the subsequent category starts
on the next line and we repeat. I wanted to read in and parse text formatted
like this:</p>

<pre><code>Directing
Amour
Michael Haneke
Beasts Of The Southern Wild
Benh Zeitlin
Life Of Pi
Ang Lee
Lincoln
Steven Spielberg
Silver Linings Playbook
David O. Russell

Actor in a Leading Role
Lincoln
Daniel Day-Lewis
…
</code></pre>

<p>And convert it to this:</p>

<pre><code>Directing,Amour,Michael Haneke
Directing,Beasts Of The Southern Wild,Benh Zeitlin
Directing,Life Of Pi,Ang Lee
Directing,Lincoln,Steven Spielberg
Directing,Silver Linings Playbook,David O. Russell
Actor in a Leading Role,Lincoln,Daniel Day-Lewis
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, to scan and parse this type of input, I would write a program to
loop over each line of the input, with a number of global state variables,
keeping track of what tokens I was currently processing. In this case, I might
have global state variables indicating whether I was currently processing a
category and what the current film is, and I would have a set of if/elif/else
statements for tests of various combinations of those variables, including for
the contents of the current line (a blank line or EOF indicating the end of a
category).</p>

<p>Each time through the loop, then, we get a line from the text and check to see
what state we’re in. While this approach is easy to get started with, it leads
to fragile code and requires a lot of mental bookkeeping. Worse, each time
through the loop, the state of where we are and what we just did is forgotten.
That accounts for the proliferation of state variables to be checked in order
to restore the state of the processing.  Think about it, we are marching
sequentially through this text, wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we could just pick up
where we left off with the last action?</p>

<p>My approach this time is inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE" title="Lexical Scanning in Go - Rob Pike">Rob Pike’s talk on lexical scanning</a>.
Instead of a loop where we get the next bit of text to examine and restore the
state of the processing by examing a number of state variables, we instead
have a loop where a function is called that returns the next function to be
called. In other words, a function is called which does a bit of processing of
the text, advancing the pointer or consuming from a stream, maybe emitting
some tokens, and then returns to the caller the function that should proceed
from where the returning function just left off. For instance, we just scanned
a category, which means we know we are ready to scan a film, so call the film
scan function. That next function can just carry on its processing without any
state-checking preliminaries. The loop of our system therefore is very
concise, just calling functions and getting the next one to call the
subsequent time around. Roughly:</p>

<pre><code>def run():
    state = start_state
    while state:
        state = state()
</code></pre>

<p>When we are done processing input, say, EOF is reached, the state function
currently executing can return <code>None</code> to the caller, which will end the while
loop and shut down the machine.</p>

<p>The advantage to the programmer is that instead of building up a complicated
switch of control to determine what state our machine is in, we simply write
functions that proceed naturally from the last state, and then hand off
control to the subsequent function. It’s clean and helps keep the complexity
of the system manageable. Any time you can reduce the number of control flow
statements and replace them with simple functions is a win in my book.</p>

<p>So back to the Oscars. This year, I opened the <a href="http://cdn.media.oscar.abc.com/media/2013/pdf/2013/nominees.pdf">official nominee list</a> from
the Academy’s site, a PDF. I selected the text, copied and pasted it into a
text document. The only manual editing I did was to add a blank line between
each group of nominees by category, and I also joined lines in categories like
Music (Original Song) where the title of the song and the name of the composer
is split across multiple lines—these were quick changes that simplified the
scanning logic.</p>

<p>There are three state functions in my program, one for each of category, film,
and name (or list of names):</p>

<pre><code>def lex_category(lexer):
    lexer.emit(CATEGORY, title(getline()))
    return lex_film

def lex_film(lexer):
    line = getline()
    if line == &#39;&#39;:
        lexer.emit(BLANK, &#39;&#39;)
        return lex_category
    elif line is None: # EOF, shut down lex machine
        return None
    lexer.emit(FILM, title(line))
    return lex_names

def lex_names(lexer):
    lexer.emit(NAMES, title(getline()))
    return lex_film
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>title()</code> handles some odd case formatting in the source text by converting
strings to title case.)</p>

<p><code>lex_film</code> is the most complex, having to handle the possibilities of a blank
line, meaning we’re moving on to the next category, EOF, which shuts down
scanning, and the film itself. But in all cases we merely return the next
state function to called (or <code>None</code>).</p>

<p>Admittedly, this is more sophistication than normally appears in my yearly
nominee list parsing. But I have to say that I was able to write the program
in about the same amount of time, found it ran correctly the first time, and
was actually kind of fun to do. And while this was a silly example, you can
start to see the power you can get from this approach when lexing different
kinds of input with more and more complex tokens. When you lift the flow of
control up a level and let your functions focus on the task at hand, the
result I think is a more elegant and more obviously correct program.</p>

<p>The script and input text are <a href="https://gist.github.com/4507999">here</a>, and the output list of nominees is
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AviXLd8uXec3dHRtenJGcUs5aTBXUEY4cWs2WHNpS3c#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
