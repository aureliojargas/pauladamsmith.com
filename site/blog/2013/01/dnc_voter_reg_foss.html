  <p>We (the <a href="http://democrats.org/">DNC</a>) have <a href="https://github.com/democrats/voter-registration/issues/12#issuecomment-12804999">relicensed the Democratic Party’s voter registration
application</a> under a standard MIT license, and accompanied the source
code with an advisory notice regarding the use of the software. I wanted to
explain why we did this.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party initially released <a href="https://github.com/democrats/voter-registration">the source code to its online voter
registration app</a> late last summer, with the intent of making it
available for all the standard reasons people and organizations choose when
they open-source code: so that it can be improved, so that bugs can be fixed,
so others can take it and build further new applications on top of it.</p>

<p>However, it was quickly apparent we had a problem with the open source
community. <a href="https://github.com/democrats/voter-registration/issues/12">The issue was with the license</a>. It contained a clause that
placed restrictions on its use. The reason this clause was included was to
address our concerns regarding the highly regulated and closely monitored
nature of voting and voter registration. We wanted to avoid a scenario where,
either inadvertently or through malice, someone set up a site based on the
code, and without following state and federal guidelines and rules, defrauded
or disenfranchised a voter. Now, regardless of our good intentions on this
matter, the fact that we had taken a standard open source license and amended
it with this restrictive clause meant that we did not pass “free and open
source” muster, with emphasis on the “free” as in “speech”.</p>

<p>We needed a solution that addressed both the problematic license and our
concerns regarding the good-faith use of the software that protected voters. A
member of the open source community, <a href="http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/">Karl Fogel</a>, stepped forward
with a proposal: change the license to an unmodified standard
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/index.html">OSI</a>-approved license, and include along with the source code an
advisory document that outline these legal concerns. The notice would not be
binding or otherwise modify the license and therefore terms of use; however,
like any piece of open source software, people are “free” to use it illegally,
and free to suffer the consequences if they do. The important thing is to
remind users of their responsibility to act in accordance with the law,
especially when it comes to something as precious and beseiged as our
franchise. We feel the combination of a standard FOSS license and a
non-binding advisory document expressing the intent of the copyright holder is
a way forward for political organizations to release potentially sensitive
soure code while at the same time communicating the vital issues animating and
conditioning that release.</p>

<p>Now, some observers may not see this as remarkable. There was a bad license,
it’s been changed, what’s the fuss? I want to acknowledge the hard work across
the organization, from software engineers to lawyers, to find a way to give
back to the open source community and satisfy the concerns of both. There are
many reasons why organizations don’t release their software as open source. We
want to set an example, however small, that there are non-license ways to
state any reservations or guiding principles your organization that ordinarily
would have prevented a release. Key among these are engaging with the
community. As we have learned time and again, good solutions often originate
through trust and dialogue.</p>
