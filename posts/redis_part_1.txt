I’ve been using Redis more and more lately, and I started poking
around in the source code trying to understand it better. I wrote <a
href="/articles/redis-under-the-hood.html">an article</a> about how
Redis starts up and processes the request/response cycle. I think this
is just the beginning of my Redis explorations—we’re already using it
quite a bit at work, and I have an idea for a new data type that could
be really useful. I plan to write at least one more longish article
like this about it, on following in close detail how a SET and a GET
command make their way through the server.

Redis is an extremely cool project. The main contributors are focused
on making it fast, bug-free, and keeping it small (in the sense of
features, code base, complexity). They're also working on a
distributed version that could be very promising, taking it beyond
what is already IMO a very successful single process model.
