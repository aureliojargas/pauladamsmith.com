The closer you get to moving, the less sentimental you are about those marginal
possessions you tote from home to home. The ones you defer action on their
final status: back in the rotation, daily use, or into archives? Or pitched,
sold, donated, excised?

I said “smell you later” to some printed t-shirts today, here are some.

### Texas "Tremodillo"

I stopped attending [college][smcm] after my freshman year, in part to go be the
[guitar tech][wiki] for a [band][foam]. This was 1996. Some friends of mine from
high school had formed it, and a major label had signed them to produce
a record. The band had me spend a week with César Díaz at his home and workshop
in Pennsylvania. César had been the tech for guitarists like Stevie Ray Vaughn
and Eric Clapton. Vaughn was, I think, César’s idol. He was a guitar player
himself, and even had his guitar set up like Stevie’s, with heavy strings and
high action. César had stopped touring, and made guitar amps and effects pedals
instead. He also would [teach new guitar techs the secrets of the
profession][ytcesar]. The Texas Tremodillo was one of two pedals he made. It had
a [tremolo][yttrem] effect, which is like a fast, regular wobble. We would spend
the day in his workshop, tinkering on an amp that had blown a capacitor, or on
a pedal that was buzzing. He was soft-spoken, reserved, and didn’t have a lot of
patience for others. At night we’d get dinner at a local Indian place, or eat
with his wife, whom I remember being kind, and their young son. One day we drove
in to New York, somewhere in the Lower East Side or Village, to peck around at
a used guitar show in an auditorium. We ran into [Jimmy Vivino][jv] outside. He
was wearing a pork pie hat and we walked around with him, looking at
guitars—they were close friends. Later that night, Vivino and a bunch of other
guys showed up at César’s workshop to jam. They played “The Weight” and many
other classic rock songs. César soloed on an Stevie Ray Vaughn song.  César was
kind to me in the end. He wasn’t too annoyed when I would later call him to ask
what to do about a failing pickup, or if I could use these tubes instead of
those in this amp. I stopped working for the band after a year or so, and forgot
about César, except when I would see the Tremodillo shirt in my closet. I rarely
wore it—it was too big, and I felt like I should preserve it somehow, which
I never made an attempt to do. Sometime later I read that he died in the early
2000s. He had been sick with liver failure not long after I visited him. At one
point he had a transplant, but he only lived another couple of years. RIP,
César.

### Vote, F*cker

![Vote, F*cker t-shirt](/images/tshirts/IMG_20140726_124417.jpg)

This is a shirt Ben Helphand gave me after a trip he took to Oregon. This would
have been around 2004. The [Bus Project][bp] the made the shirt. Ben and
I became friends after we went to Minnesota in 2002, volunteering on the senate
campaign of the late [Paul Wellstone][pw]. After that, we scheme up ways to try
to improve small-d democratic participation. The Bus Project was a big part of
the inspiration that led to the creation of the [Election Day Advent
Calendar][edac] in 2006. I’ll miss the Vote, F*cker shirt but many washes
rendered it too shrunken and I looked like a sausage in it.

### Pope Benedict’s Army

![Pope Benedict’s Army t-shirt](/images/tshirts/IMG_20140726_124533.jpg)

In 2005, I played on a co-ed softball team with my then-girlfriend, now-wife
Michelle. We had been dating for a few months, and exploring a new group of
friends in common together, some of whom were on the team. A conclave had
elected Joseph Ratzinger pope on April 19. Three weeks later, the team
organizer, John Pick, wrote the potential players an email:

<blockquote>
I pulled the trigger on the league and put it on my
credit card.<br>
<br>
Belmont and California<br>
6:15- 7:15<br>
Thurs nights<br>
starting June 2<br>
80 per person.<br>
<br>
we're called Pope Benedict's Army
</blockquote>

IIRC, we did not do the pontiff proud. I think we might have won one game?

Molly Sircher, who was our ringer, conceived and produced the shirt. She had
played softball at DePaul, and was by far the best player on our team. I wanted
to hang on to the shirt, but the shape was a little boxy, and it had a musty
smell it picked up probably during that summer and never got rid of.

### PyCon US 2012

![PyCon US 2012 t-shirt](/images/tshirts/IMG_20140726_124615.jpg)

In 2012, I gave a [talk][talk] at [PyCon][pycon] for the first and so far only
time. The U.S. conference was in Santa Clara, CA, near San Jose. At the time,
I was [the deputy director of technology at the DNC][dnc]. I was eager to attend
tech conferences during my tenure there, to try to recruit software engineers to
work with me on the campaign. This trip was a bust on that score, and I felt
afterwards that my presentation had been lackluster. In retrospect, it was
a stressed time. I felt like we didn’t have enough engineering help at the DNC
to get through the campaign, and that it was difficult to attract any. I always
liked [Idan Gazit’s][ig] official PyCon snake logo that year and thought it was
a handsome shirt. But it’s too small now, into the donation pile you go.
