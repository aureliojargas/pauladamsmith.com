Motivated by irrational hatred and overstated claims of the continuing
utility of a 3.5" floppy disk icon to mean “save”:

* Handset icon, meaning “phone,” on every iPhone, Android
* e**mail**
* Web**site** (implies a physical place)
* Wrench or cog icon, meaning “settings” or “preferences”
* Shopping cart icon
* Clock with analog hands, meaning “time” or time-centric application
* Incandescent light bulb, several meanings, including energy settings
* Bound, paper book, meaning “book”

Of course there are many, many anachronistic interface elements and metaphors
in the world, and [we get by okay](/blog/2010/10/old_things.html). Mainly,
this is because new generations don’t suddenly appear next to us and
start using our computers without any foreknowledge of the metaphorical
items. They spend time learning with the old fogeys for whom information was
sometimes stored inside square pieces of plastic and metal. This overlap is
necessary in general because knowledge about tools is not encoded in our
genetic material. All understanding of _use_ is part of a multi-layered
strata of culture, experience, and relationships.

The real problem anti-floppy-disk people have is explaining a harm,
specifically, a harm that matters. Often when we think of user interface
improvements that matter, we think of examples like improving medical devices
to reduce user error, changes that literally save people’s lives. Or
tweaks to software that improve user efficiency and productivity, saving
money. It’s hard to conceive of what might be improved by finding a better
metaphor for “save” other than some designers’ personal sensibilities.
