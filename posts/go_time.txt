Go takes an interesting approach to [parsing strings to time objects,
and formatting time objects as strings][1]. Instead of using codes like
most languages to represent component parts of a date/time string
representation—like `%Y` for a 4-digit year like “2011” or `%b`
for an abbreviated month name like “Feb”—Go uses a mnemonic device:
there is a standard time, which is:

    Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006  (MST is GMT-0700)

Or put another way:

    01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700

Instead of having to remember or lookup the traditional formatting codes for
functions like `strftime`, you just count one-two-three-four and each place
in the standard time corresponds to a component of a date/time object (the
`Time` type in Go): one for day of the month, two for the month, three for
the hour (in 12-hour time), four for the minutes, etc.

The way you put this into action is by putting together the parts of
the standard time in a layout string that matches the format of either
the string representation you want to parse into a `Time` object or the
opposite direction, when you want to generate a string representation from
an `Time` object.

Parsing:

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func main() {
        value  := "Thu, 05/19/11, 10:47PM"
        // Writing down the way the standard time would look like formatted our way
        layout := "Mon, 01/02/06, 03:04PM"
        t, _ := time.Parse(layout, value)
        fmt.Println(t)
    }

    // => "Thu May 19 22:47:00 +0000 2011"

Formatting:

    package main

    import (
        "fmt"
        "time"
    )

    func main() {
        t := time.SecondsToLocalTime(1305861602)
        t.ZoneOffset = -4*60*60
        fmt.Println(t.Format("2006-01-02 15:04:05 -0700"))
    }

    // => "2011-05-20 03:20:02 -0400"

There are predefined constants in the `time` package for common formats
such as RFCs 822 and 3339.

The use of a mnemonic over obscure formatting codes I think reflects the
pragmatism of Go’s developers and their focus on creating a language
that makes its users more productive. While it is a break with tradition
to abandon `strftime`-style formatting, they probably recognized that most
developers, no matter how experienced, reach for `man strftime` or similar
documentation more often than not (hell, I have a mug with the codes printed
on it), and each time they do, it is an expensive context switch, in terms
of lost focus. Writing the standard time down the way yours looks may be
quirky, but it's easy to recall, and it also happens to match the shape of
your time string, syntatically.

It’s fascinating to see a language with the pedigree of Go—from the
minds of long-time C and Unix developers—toss aside certain old and
venerable ways of doing things. But it’s consistent with a language
that’s relatively small (in the good way of being comprehensible and
coherent), focused on efficiency, and careful in what it includes.
