Software that helps civil society organizations—non-profits, NGOs,
charities—do their work should be better. It can be better. I want to help
make it better. That’s why [I’ve started, along with two colleagues from the
2012 election][st], a new company, called [Public Good Software][pgs].

If you survey the kind of technology that <abbr title="civil society
organizations">CSOs</abbr> use to support their missions, it’s a sorry sight.
It’s full of complex interfaces and complicated experiences, thin layers over
old systems, aging and poorly-supported applications, and disconnected data.
Worse, the companies that develop and sell this software seem to have
stagnated—their websites often feel frozen in time from 10 years ago. There
isn’t a lot of innovation happening here.

This is frustrating. These organizations are increasingly counted on to
confront our most serious challenges, like hunger, climate change,
conservation, joblessness, homelessness, affordable housing, poverty, public
health, literacy and education, and yet the technology tools they need are not
keeping up with them. Why shouldn’t people who work at CSOs expect software
every bit as good and as powerful as what they use on their smartphones
everyday?

The situation is not much better if you are a supporter of these
organizations. Let’s say you give $100 a year to your local public radio
station, volunteer regularly at a community garden, and write your
congressperson on behalf of an animal rights advocacy campaign. You should be
able to keep track of all you do, and if you choose, share it with your
community. You should be able to find new opportunities that you might not
have been aware of, based on the kinds of organizations you support.  You have
a civic profile, based on how you help others, that you should be able to
claim and control.

The first problem to tackle, and the first product that PGS will be developing
to help solve, is the problem of disconnected data. It’s a fundamental problem
that impacts CSOs and their supporters. Information about donors is in one
database, volunteers in another, email subscribers in a third, then there's
Facebook likers and Twitter followers and you don’t know if they’re in the
other databases … Think of Mint.com, the way that service in its early days
brought sanity to your financial life. We want to connect these disparate
databases in much the same way and provide CSOs with a new, high-level view of
their data, with more complete pictures of their supporters. We’ll do this
through the use of statistical models, summaries, and visualizations that let
CSOs track how they are doing on the goals they set for themselves. This will
become a platform on which, over time, we’ll create and add new products.

We aren’t setting out to reinvent the wheel. We’re not building YACRM (yet
another CRM). We’re not even aiming to replace the technology CSOs currently
use. We want to provide new tools and experiences that reflect the new needs
of these organizations and their supporters. And it will be great, modern
software: fast, a pleasure to use, designed and built for mobile devices, with
maps and geo data throughout, and ready for international users. This is what
CSOs and their supporters deserve.

We decided early on that we wanted to be aligned with our customers in a way
that was sustainable, that built trust, and held us as a company accountable
to ensure that a double-bottom-line isn’t just a convenience to be discarded
when the “real” pressure (i.e., financial) builds up. At the same time, we
knew that the best way to grow the company the way we believed it should was
through traditional capital investment. That led us to become a [benefit
corporation][bc]. <a href="#fn" id="fnr">*</a> This is new legislation,
found in a dozen or so states, and we think we’re one of the first software
startups to go that route. Essentially what this means is that we are in all
other respects like a normal for-profit company (we are a C corp under the
hood), but that we have a social mission, stated right in our corporate
by-laws (ours is roughly “to return more capital to organizations that provide
a benefit to the public”), and there are two mechanisms ensuring that the
social mission is not discarded if it becomes inconvenient. One is that there
is a board-level position called the social benefit director, whose job is to
ensure that the company is sticking to the social mission. The other is that
our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders does not override that social
mission. This is where the rubber meets the road—you won’t see PGS suddenly
pivot to sell software to the NRA to return a few more percentage points to
our investors.

All this comes at an interesting time for the public sector.  Executive
directors and supporters alike are demanding more accountability and better
ways of measuring success or failure. At the same time, demand for CSO
services is up, while capital—in the form of dollars and volunteer time—is
flat, or even declining slightly. There is a small but increasingly vocal
minority of development directors saying CSOs need to be less obsessed with
converting every dollar to program, and to find new ways to expand and be more
effective. All this leads to an increasing need for better data and analysis,
and better tools—for fundraising, communications, volunteer mobilization—that
build on it. We think there is an enormous opportunity here.

So it will be fun. I’m the CTO. My co-founders [Jason][jdk] and [Dan][dan]
were director of UX and director of development, respectively, in the OFA 2012
technology department. We’ve also got two more OFA tech alums,
[Chris][cgansen] and [Aaron][aaron], as part of the founding team. Our current
status is, talking with potential investors, meeting with a handful of CSOs
who’ve agreed to pilot the software as we build it, and making prototypes and
getting our basic infrastructure running. We’re using [Go][go] for our server
software, which is a fun language. Incidentally, it should go without saying
that we’re big believers in open source, but most of what we develop will be
available under an open source license, and I’ll write more about that in
another later post.  But I’ve already released some open source software that
was developed on PGS time, [gogeos][gogeos], a small Go library for working
with geospatial data.  We’ll be hiring software engineers soon, so if any of
this sounds interesting to you, [drop me a line][paulatpgs].
