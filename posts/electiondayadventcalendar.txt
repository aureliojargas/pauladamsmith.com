My friend Ben Helphand and I started scheming in 2005 on a way to
celebrate the right to vote. We believed that a great nation deserves
great civic rituals, and the election season was the natural time for
such a ritual. What we came up with was [the Election Day Advent
Calendar for 2006][2006]. The idea was simple: inspired by the
traditional Advent calendar for Christmas, our calendar let you open a
door a day through Election Day, and reveal interesting facts and quotes
about our democracy and the history of voting. It would be non-partisan
but not scrubbed of parties, a reflection on the many events and people
that comprise the story of the franchise.

We wanted to make a real calendar that you could buy and hang up.
Neither of us had any experience in the print production world, and we
both had day jobs in different fields. We had to figure out all the
steps of the process, from hiring an artist to forming an LLC to sales
and shipping and marketing. We put up our own money to fund it, and
hoped to sell enough just to break even.

The response to that first Calendar was strong, and told us there was a
desire for such products that let us all celebrate the shared history of
American politics. People were delighted by the concept; when they saw
it, they got it. We heard from teachers that it made a great part of
their back-to-school civics lesson plans, and from many people who said
they gave it out as a gift to a politics-nerd friend or colleague.

After repeating the process in [2008][2008], we took a break in 2010 but
didn’t give up on the core idea. What we needed, though, was a different
approach to paying for production—it was just too risky to put up our
own money time and again. In meantime, along came Kickstarter.  It’s
perfect for a project like ours.

As I write, there are 6 days remaining in our campaign, and we’re a
little more than half way to our goal. If you’re reading these words and
like what I’ve described, **[please support our Kickstarter][ks]**.

Our motto with Gerrymander, the small company Ben and I founded for the
Calendar, is “Make Small Plans”. It’s gently mocking riff on Daniel
Burnham’s famous and possibly apocryphal [quote][burnham]. Our republic,
as great and large as it is, is still composed of the small democratic
actions of all of us, and those things require care and feeding, and
they ask to be done well. If the Election Day Advent Calendar provides
civic nourishment in any way, then it will have been a success.
