I am announcing the initial release of [gogeos][gogeos], a library for the Go
programming language. gogeos provides spatial data operations and geometric
algorithms. While it is a Go library, the hard work is done by the
[GEOS][geos] C library.

The kinds of things you can do with gogeos include:

* **set-theoretic operations**, such as computing the intersection, union, or
  difference of two geometries,
* **topological operations**, such as computing buffers and convex hulls,
* **binary predicates**, such as whether two geometries intersect or are disjoint,
* **validity checking**, and
* **[much more](http://paulsmith.github.io/gogeos/#overview)**.

It also provides interoperability with other spatial data processing systems
like [PostGIS][pgis] by decoding and encoding geometries as Well-Known Text
(WKT) and Well-Known Binary (WKB).

I started working on gogeos because I looked at the landscape of GIS and
spatial data libraries for Go, and found it lacking. Binding to the GEOS
library with [cgo][cgo] was a way to get started quickly. Relying on GEOS has
its drawbacks, for instance, it creates a large binary dependency, and cgo
doesn’t allow for cross-platform compiles.

In the long term, I would like to create a pure Go library that implements
functionality such as GEOS and the [JTS][jts] provide. That would allow for use
on platforms that don’t or can’t support C shared libraries, such as Google
App Engine, and make it easier for developers to get started working with it.

In the meantime, I hope that gogeos enables more developers who are working
with spatial data or GIS to get involved in the Go ecosystem.

gogeos is a [fully open-source project][github], and I welcome contributors
and feedback.
