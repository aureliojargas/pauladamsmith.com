For the past 18 days, I have been part of the so-called “[tech surge][1]” that
is helping to fix [healthcare.gov][2].

We have already [improved performance and stability][3] of the site, and have
helped to establish better processes for getting things done. There is still a
lot of work to do to make the site the stable platform it needs to be.

There is much talk about, but for now I am staying focused on the work ahead.
