<h2>Democratic National Committee (DNC)</h2>

<p>I was the Deputy Director of Technology at the <a
href="http://democrats.org/">DNC</a> from the fall of 2011 to the spring of
2013, during the 2012 presidential and general election. I oversaw our
software engineering efforts and worked to help re-elect President Obama and
put Democrats into office across the country. We collaborated closely with the
OFA campaign in Chicago, providing technical assistance, institutional
knowledge, and developing our own suite of software packages. These were
mainly focussed on volunteer and voter engagement, and get-out-the-vote (GOTV)
efforts. For example, I led the development of the party’s polling place
locator (seen at right), which also powered the Obama campaign’s polling place
lookup tool, and handled millions of requests from voters during the GOTV
weekend leading up to Election Day 2012. I also created the Digital Slate
Card, which gave voters a list of the endorsed Democratic candidates that
would be on the ballot where they were registered to vote.</p>

<h2>EveryBlock</h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://everyblock.com/">EveryBlock</a>
with <a href="http://holovaty.com/">Adrian
Holovaty</a>, <a href="http://wilsonminer.com/">Wilson Miner</a>,
and <a href="http://www.derivativeworks.com/">Dan X. O’Neil</a> in
2007 in Chicago.</p>

<p>I developed the site along with Adrian, writing Python code for the
Django-based application, administering the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database,
writing JavaScript for various front-end elements including our
OpenLayers-based custom maps. We were early users of Mapnik, which we used to
create the map tiles. I also developed a custom nginx module to efficiently
serve the tiles. I wrote <a
href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/takecontrolofyourmaps" title="Take
Control of Your Maps (A List Part No. 256)">an article about our maps</a>.
</p>

<h2>Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail</h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href="http://bloomingdaletrail.org/">Friends of the
Bloomingdale Trail</a> in 2003, an all-volunteer non-profit
organization that advocates for the conversion of an unused elevated
rail line on the north side of Chicago to a multi-use greenspace and
park. I designed and developed the FBT site, which is a Django app.

<h2>Election Day Advent Calendar</h2>

<figure>

<p>In 2006, my co-conspirator Ben Helphand and I, calling ourselves
“<a href="http://gerrymanderpresents.com/">Gerrymander</a>” (slogan: Make
Small Plans), conceived, designed (with help from Andrew Seay), produced,
printed, and sold <a href="http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2006/">the
Election Day Advent Calendar</a>. Like a regular Advent calendar
counts down the days ‘til Christmas, our political-nerd take on it
counted down the days leading up to the 2006 midterm election. You
opened a door each day and it would reveal a quote or fact about our
democracy. This was an actual 11"×17", full-color, printed, die-cut
calendar. We sold a fair number, more or less broke even, and declared
it a success from our modest expectations. With design help from <a
href="http://mdeanstudio.com">Melissa Dean</a>, we repeated the effort in
with <a href="http://electiondayadventcalendar.com/2008/">a new calendar
for the 2008 election</a>.
</p>

<h2>Chris Hayes</h2>

<p>I designed and developed another Django app in 2006, a personal
site for my friend the
journalist <a href="http://chrishayes.org/">Chris Hayes</a>,
Washington editor of The Nation and an MSNBC contributor.
</p>

<h2>Crain’s sites</h2>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>As part of my freelance web developer career, I made a number of web
apps for Crain’s Chicago Business, based around a news cycle and a
data set. One example
was <a href="http://interactive.chicagobusiness.com/daley/">Mayor
Daley’s Contributions</a>, which let you query a database of
contributions made to the mayor in the run-up to the 2007 municipal
elections. The contributions were also mapped. This was a Django app.
</p>

<h2>Civic Footprint</h2>

</figure>

<p>I created a site while at the <a href="http://cnt.org/">Center for
Neighborhood Technology</a> in 2005 called the Civic Footprint. This
was a site where you typed in your address, and it showed you who
represented you politically, down to the local level (congressman,
state senator, alderman, etc.), and a map of all your political
geographies. This was an early Ruby on Rails site, and I hacked in
geospatial support to ActiveRecord so that I could make queries
against the PostGIS database containing the political boundaries. The
maps were generated by <a href="http://mapserver.org/">MapServer</a>.
